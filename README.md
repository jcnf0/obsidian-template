# My Obsidian Template
This repository contains the current structure, plugins, and settings of my Obsidian vault. It is meant to be a starting place to recreate a vault and a way for me to organize my own vault.

**Note:** The structure of my vault is constantly refined as I see fit. I took inspiration from files and configurations that I've seen and assembled them in a way that makes sense for me, but there might be better ways to organize your own vault depending on profile.

## The Vault
### Structure
This subset of my vault contains the structure for my research (which I split into *coding*, *reading*, and *writing*) and miscellaneous utilities as follows:

```
Vault
├── MISC
│   ├── ATTACHMENTS
│   ├── DAILY NOTES
│   ├── EXCALIDRAW
│   ├── MOC
│   ├── PEOPLE
│   ├── TASK CALENDAR
│   ├── TASK TIMELINE
│   ├── TEMPLATES
│   └── WEEKLY NOTES
├── PERSONAL
│   ├── ADMIN
│   │   └── ARTIFACT REVIEWS
│   ├── CHORES
│   ├── DIARY
│   │   └── THOUGHTS
├── RESEARCH
│   ├── CODE
│   │   └── ARTIFACT REVIEWS
│   ├── LOGISTICS
│   ├── MEETINGS
│   ├── READING
│   │   ├── NOTES
│   │   └── REVIEWS
│   └── WRITING
├── Homepage.md
└── README.md
```
### Daily Notes
The main point of the vault is the use of the daily notes, which helps set tasks and create specific types of notes. Each daily notes is made of 3 sections:
- **Meta Bind Buttons** to create specific notes (Meeting, Review, Paper Notes, etc.)
- **Tasks/Notes** with a custom query to see tasks by priority, due date
- **Notes Created/Edited Today** 

## Plugins
I use a decent amount of plugins that I divide in two categories: plugins for the appearance of the vault and plugins that are meant to improve my efficiency.

## Credits
The CSS and JS from `MISC/TASK CALENDAR` and `MISC/TASK TIMELINE` are slightly modified from https://github.com/702573N/Obsidian-Tasks-Calendar and https://github.com/702573N/Obsidian-Tasks-Timeline, respectively.
